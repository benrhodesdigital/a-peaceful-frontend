Introduction
 Lightweight (do you really need all those dependancies)
 Performant architecture

Why you should care

What this series aims to do
 - lightweight scaleable frontend architecture
 - Looking at each area from the point of view of a greenfield or brownfield project

Frameworks and dependencies
 - Be concious of what you choose. They come and go, do you really need one?

Measuring performance
- page speeds
- light house
- chrome

Service workers

 - creating one
 - managing life of a service worker 
 - service worker frameworks

 - developer experience
 - linting
 - less red tape
 - git
 - perceptual difference testing
   - test dev not production, 

Performance focused framework Case studies
