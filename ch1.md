# Peaceful front-end development
#Chapter 1: Introduction
Welcome to peaceful front end development.

This title is for those who have ever found themselves deep in the underbelly of a grimey hostile code base, where janky performance is rampant, with all sorts of side effects and dark magic makes testing take longer than a release cycle, code is buggy and hard to ship - basically your project is chaos. Likewise, if you have been tasked with a greenfield project and are worried those fields will turn to a tar pit. Than this title is for you. 

That was fairly descriptive, you can probably feel the pain, every developer has been there, and every developer throughout their career has found very different ways to try control this chaos. This title is an effort by two developers John Hardy and Ben Rhodes to try document the different ways you can and others have made clean, lightweight, performant, understandable, side effect-less code. Although we will most be looking at first principle concepts, we hope the ideas and process shown can help those of you working on projects that you want to tame.
